## 🧠 Architecture & Design Decisions

MediLens+ emphasizes modularity, security, and real-world performance — ideal for handling sensitive medical data on mobile devices.

### 🧱 App Structure
- **Modular architecture (React Native + TypeScript)**
- **Feature-first foldering**: Scan, Results, History, etc.
- **Unidirectional state flow** with Context API
- **Secure, offline-first experience** using Expo Secure Store

### 🎨 Design Principles
- **Minimalist interface**: Zero clutter, high legibility
- **Accessibility-aware**: High-contrast, scalable fonts
- **User-centered UX**: Built for patients, caregivers, doctors

### 🔐 Security Highlights
- **End-to-End Encryption (AES-256)** in storage and transit
- **No developer access** to user medical data
- **Granular Firestore rules (planned)** for per-user access
- **Local-only data control**: Nothing leaves the device without permission

### ☁️ Cloud & Deployment
- **Firebase-first** strategy for seamless auth, storage, and sync
- **Zero-trust architecture**: All requests validated with secure rules
- **Serverless cloud functions** *(future)* for NLP, analytics, reminders

### 🔭 Future-Proofing
